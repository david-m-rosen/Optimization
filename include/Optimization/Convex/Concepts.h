/** Useful typedefs for implementing templated/parameterized convex optimization
 * methods.
 *
 * In the following definitions:
 *
 * - Variable is the type of the argument of the objective function (i.e., this
 * is the type of variable to be optimized).  As this represents an element of a
 * convex set (a subset of an affine space), this type must support addition,
 * subtraction, and scalar multiplication (implemented as operator +, -, and *,
 * respectively), as well as well as an inner product operation, implemented as
 * a method .dot()
 *
 * - Args is a user-definable variadic template parameter whose instances will
 * be passed into each of the functions required to run the optimization
 * algorithm (objective, quadratic model constructor, linear operators,
 * retractions, and acceptance function); this enables e.g. the use of
 * objectives accepting non-optimized parameters of arbitrary types, and/or the
 * use of arbitrary user-defined cache variables in order to store and reuse
 * intermediate results in different parts of the computation.
